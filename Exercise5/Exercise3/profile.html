		<p><br>My cat's official name is "Raganwood Viola Vibrato", but she more 
commonly 
goes by "Viola" and "Hey don't touch that".<br><br> </p>
		
		<p><br>Viola is a silver spotted Bengal cat from <a 
href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Pet-Store/Raganwood-Bengals-Savannahs-260073734037980/"> 
Raganwood Bengals and Savannahs</a>, and she's got all the charming personality 
you'd expect of one. From her chirpy bark to her fondness of playing in the toilet, her 
strange quirks are sure to brighten up your day -- or at least make for a fun story to tell 
after you've cleaned up!<br><br></p>
	
		<p><br>Viola is an F8 Bengal, which means she's eight generations removed 
from her 
Asian Leopard Cat ancestor. By tracing <a 
href="https://bengalpedigrees.com/kitten.php?sticanum=SBT051309017&dticanum=SBT031008017">her 
pedigree in the Bengal Database</a>, you can even find out that her closest wild ancestor is a cat named Maximus. An intriguing note is that her 
father carries the wild allele that causes the charcoal coloration in some Bengals. This 
coloration is caused by the interactions of the agouti and non-agouti alleles in the Leopard 
Cat and in the domestic cat. It's quite possible that Viola inherited that wild allele 
herself! <br><br></p>
